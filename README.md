# Python-Live-Project
My Python live project for The Tech Academy's Software Developer Bootcamp

Overview:
Developed a full-stack Django application with basic Create, Read, and Detail functionality. The app enables users to add, view, and explore items stored in a database through a clean and responsive web interface.

Key Features:

Created a custom Django app with modular templates (base.html, home.html, details.html) for a consistent layout.

Built a data model in models.py and connected it to a form (ModelForm) so users can add new items directly through the site.

Implemented a list view that retrieves all database records and displays them dynamically in a structured table.

Added detailed item pages linked from the main list, using URL parameters and context data to render the correct entry.

Applied basic CSS styling for cohesive navigation, spacing, and color themes.

Technical Stack:
Django · Python · HTML · CSS · SQLite

Outcome:
Successfully deployed a functional prototype demonstrating core CRUD operations, clean template structure, and integration between Django models, views, and URLs.
